A Jetty server is embedded in order to ease the project execution.

Terminal execution:
    - mvn clean
    - mvn compile
    - mvn jetty:run

Pagination Design decisions:
    - Query-based selection parameters. Offset will be the initial element. Limit will be the number of returning results.
    - Response Header: X-Total-Count to retrieve the total number of results.
    - Link header to help the client when gettin first, last, next and previous page.
